# EIT_lightcurves
Sun-as-a-star light curves from the SOHO Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope

Files with "corrected_all" in the name are version (1) light curves from the paper. These are uniformly corrected for instrumental systematics across the entire mission baseline, except the inter-bakeout segments in 1996 and 1997 with no $284\AA\$ data, where vertical inter-bakeout segment offsets cannot be calculated. (See section 2.6.3 of the paper.)
Files with "corrected_2008onwards" in the name are version (2) light curves from the paper. These are corrected for bakeout systematics only after 12 November 2008.

Files with "heliocentriccorr" in the name have been corrected for EIT's viewing angle on the Sun. 

Files with "metadata" in the name have other metadata from the original EIT fits files, including SOHO's heliocentric position at the time of observation. Each metadata file has the same number of lines as any of its corresponding light curve files.
